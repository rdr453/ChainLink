## Breakpoint Feature

The Breakpoint feature allows users to pause the execution of a pipeline at designated points. Users can set breakpoints through the UI, and the execution will stop when a breakpoint is reached.

### How to Use
1. Click on the **Set Breakpoint** button to activate a breakpoint.
2. The button will change to **Breakpoint Active**.
3. To remove the breakpoint, click the button again.

### Example
- When running a pipeline, if a breakpoint is active, the execution will pause, allowing users to inspect the current state.
