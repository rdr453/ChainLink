# ChainLink: Automating AI Collaboration with ChainForge

**ChainLink** is an open-source extension of [ChainForge](https://github.com/ianarawjo/ChainForge), designed to automate collaboration among AI agents. By enabling multiple AI models to interact and work together, ChainLink enhances the capabilities of ChainForge, facilitating more complex and efficient AI workflows.

## Features

- **Automated AI Collaboration**: Enable multiple AI agents to communicate and collaborate on tasks, enhancing problem-solving capabilities.
- **Modular Architecture**: Refactored codebase for easy integration and deployment, supporting package management systems like PyPI and Docker.
- **User-Friendly Deployment**: Provide downloadable packages and Docker images for straightforward installation and setup.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed guides for installation, usage, and contribution to assist users and developers.

## Project Inspiration and Goals

ChainLink was inspired by the need to streamline AI collaboration processes. Building upon ChainForge's foundation, ChainLink aims to create a platform where AI agents can autonomously interact, share knowledge, and optimize workflows, thereby advancing the field of AI research and application.
